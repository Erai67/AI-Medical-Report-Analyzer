The Problem
Medical reports are often filled with technical jargon and complex data that can be confusing and intimidating for the average person. This language barrier can cause anxiety and prevent people, especially in rural areas or those without a medical background, from understanding their own health status and taking the right next steps. My own family's difficulty in understanding these reports inspired this project.

The Solution
This tool bridges that gap. By using the power of the Google Gemini AI, it takes a medical report—either as pasted text or a photo—and provides a simple, clear, and compassionate explanation in the user's chosen language. It's designed to be accessible to everyone, empowering them with the knowledge they need to have more informed conversations with their doctors.

Key Features
Dual Input Methods: Users can either paste text directly or upload a photo of their report.

Multi-Language Support: The entire interface and the final analysis are available in several major Indian languages.

AI-Powered Analysis: Leverages Google's powerful AI to "read" and interpret the reports.

Simple Explanations: Breaks down complex medical terms and explains what they mean in plain language.

Secure: Your API key is required for analysis but is not stored or saved anywhere.
